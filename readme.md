ShapeShuft
================================================================================

ShapeShuft is an attempt to translate the design principles of
darkwiiplayer/shapeshift into idiomatic Ruby.

It tries to make validating and normalizing nested data structures easy by
providing a generalized concept of "Transformations", which can double as
validations by failing on invalid input.
